# Student_service-Exam_Analysis
First ever database, created as high school project over a span of 2 school years.\
\
This project was mandatory part of Databases class that i had in high school.\
It was done in two parts.\
First part was database design which was the part that was created in span of 2 months (April-May 2020.)\
and included only the basic concepts which we learned in school.\
\
Second part was its realisation, it was done over 3 months (March-May 2021.) and included actual creation of the database.\
\
Database isn't perfect, as expected, since its cruical part (design) was done when i had only the basic ideas about databases.\
Most of its shortcomings i found when i was creating it in the third year.\
\
Database was created in Oracle Sql and the projects' paper contains some PL/SQL examples.
\
Data inside the database isn't reall and is just a placehoder data used for doing tasks on the database.
There are two scripts:\
First was manually writen (Student_service.sql).\
Second was generated by Oracle Data Modeler (Student_service_DATA_MODELER.ddl).
